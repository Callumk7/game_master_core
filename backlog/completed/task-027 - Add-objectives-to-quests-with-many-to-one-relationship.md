## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement a new objectives table with a many-to-one relationship to quests. Each objective will have a body (description), completion status, optional note link, and quest association. This will allow quests to have multiple trackable objectives that can be managed independently.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Create objectives table migration with fields: body (string), complete (boolean, default false), note_link_id (foreign key to notes), quest_id (foreign key to quests)
- [x] #2 Create Objective Ecto schema with proper associations and validations
- [x] #3 Update Quest schema to include has_many :objectives association
- [x] #4 Create Objective context functions for CRUD operations
- [x] #5 Implement API endpoints for objective management (create, read, update, delete)
- [x] #6 Add objective routes to Phoenix router
- [x] #7 Update Swagger documentation to include new objective endpoints
- [x] #8 Write comprehensive tests for Objective schema, context, and API endpoints
- [x] #9 Write tests for Quest-Objective association functionality
- [x] #10 Ensure database constraints are properly tested
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Database Layer
   - Create objectives migration with proper fields and constraints
   - Include foreign key constraints to quests and notes tables
   - Add appropriate indexes for performance

2. Schema and Context Layer
   - Create Objective Ecto schema following existing patterns
   - Add has_many :objectives association to Quest schema
   - Implement Objectives context module with CRUD functions
   - Follow existing scope-based access patterns from Quests context

3. API Layer
   - Create ObjectiveController with standard REST endpoints
   - Implement JSON serialization for objectives
   - Add nested routes under quests for objectives management
   - Include proper error handling and authorization

4. Swagger Documentation
   - Create ObjectiveSwagger module for API documentation
   - Update quest swagger to include objectives relationship
   - Document all new endpoints with proper schemas

5. Testing
   - Create ObjectivesFixtures for test data generation
   - Write comprehensive tests for Objective schema validations
   - Test Objectives context functions and edge cases
   - Test API controller endpoints and authorization
   - Test Quest-Objective association functionality
   - Ensure database constraints are properly tested

6. Integration and Validation
   - Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
   - Test the complete flow from API to database
   - Validate swagger documentation generation
   - Test quest deletion cascading to objectives

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented quest objectives feature with full CRUD functionality:

- Created objectives table migration with proper constraints and indexes
- Implemented Objective Ecto schema with validations and associations
- Added has_many :objectives association to Quest schema
- Created comprehensive Objectives context with all CRUD operations
- Implemented ObjectiveController with nested REST endpoints under quests
- Added complete/uncomplete functionality for objective status management
- Updated Swagger documentation with full API schemas and endpoint documentation
- Created comprehensive test coverage including:
  - Objectives context tests (24 tests)
  - Quest-Objective association tests (11 tests)
  - Objective controller tests (22 tests)
- All database constraints properly tested including cascading deletes
- Proper scope-based authorization implemented
- Foreign key constraints for quest_id (required) and note_link_id (optional)

The implementation follows existing codebase patterns and includes proper error handling, validation, and security measures.
