## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Build /tree endpoint for Characters to fetch hierarchical child note structures using the new polymorphic parent relationships. This enables frontend components to display note trees attached to specific characters.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Create character note tree function in Notes context
- [x] #2 Add tree endpoint to CharacterController for GET .../characters/:id/notes/tree
- [x] #3 Update router configuration for character tree route
- [x] #4 Add Swagger documentation for character note tree endpoint
- [x] #5 Create comprehensive tests for character tree endpoint and context function
- [x] #6 Ensure proper authentication and game scoping
- [x] #7 Support both polymorphic parents (with parent_type) and traditional note hierarchies
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Study existing location/quest tree implementations for pattern reference\n2. Create character note tree function in Notes context using polymorphic parent relationships\n3. Add tree endpoint to CharacterController with proper authentication\n4. Update router configuration for character note tree route\n5. Add Swagger documentation for the new endpoint\n6. Create comprehensive tests for both context function and controller endpoint\n7. Fix duplicate acceptance criteria and verify all functionality works

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully implemented character note tree endpoint with full functionality:

## What was implemented:
- Created list_character_notes_tree_for_game/2 function in Notes context that builds hierarchical note structures for characters using polymorphic parent relationships
- Added notes_tree/2 action to CharacterController handling GET /api/games/:game_id/characters/:character_id/notes/tree
- Updated router.ex to include the new nested route under characters resources
- Added comprehensive Swagger documentation with CharacterNotesTreeData and NoteTreeNode schemas  
- Created full test suite covering normal cases, edge cases, authentication, and permissions

## Technical decisions:
- Used flexible parameter handling (character_id = params["character_id"] || params["id"]) to support both nested route parameter styles
- Implemented proper game scoping and authentication following existing patterns
- Used assert_error_sent for 404 test cases following codebase conventions
- Fixed unused variable warnings by prefixing with underscores

## Files modified:
- lib/game_master_core/notes.ex - Added list_character_notes_tree_for_game/2
- lib/game_master_core_web/controllers/character_controller.ex - Added notes_tree action
- lib/game_master_core_web/controllers/character_json.ex - Added notes_tree response  
- lib/game_master_core_web/router.ex - Added character notes tree route
- lib/game_master_core_web/swagger_definitions.ex - Added new schemas
- test files - Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality

All tests pass (751 tests, 0 failures) with no warnings.
