## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Allow characters to specify which faction they belong to and their role within that faction. This involves adding optional fields to track faction membership and role, updating the database schema, API endpoints, and documentation.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Add member_of_faction_id field to character schema (optional)
- [ ] #2 Add faction_role field to character schema (optional)
- [ ] #3 Update character creation/update API endpoints to handle faction fields
- [ ] #4 Add database migration for new character fields
- [ ] #5 Update swagger documentation to reflect new character fields
- [ ] #6 Write tests for character faction membership functionality
- [ ] #7 Ensure faction_role validation when member_of_faction_id is present
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
## Investigation Summary

After thorough investigation of the codebase, I discovered that faction membership for characters is already fully implemented through the CharacterFaction join table with rich metadata support. The system includes:

âœ… **Existing Infrastructure:**
- CharacterFaction join table with relationship_type, description, strength, is_active, metadata fields
- Complete API endpoints for linking characters to factions
- Full business logic in Characters context module
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Swagger documentation
- Security and scoping mechanisms

## Implementation Plan

Given that the core functionality exists, this task requires:

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Gap Assessment (30 min)
1. Review each acceptance criterion against existing implementation
2. Identify specific gaps between current system and task requirements
3. Determine if task needs direct character fields vs. using existing relationship system
4. Consult with stakeholders on preferred approach

### Phase 2: Schema Design Decision (45 min)
5. **Option A**: Add direct member_of_faction_id/faction_role fields to character schema
   - Pros: Simple direct access, matches task AC exactly
   - Cons: Redundant with existing system, limits to single faction membership
6. **Option B**: Enhance existing CharacterFaction relationship system
   - Pros: Leverages existing infrastructure, supports multiple faction memberships
   - Cons: More complex queries for primary faction
7. **Option C**: Hybrid approach with primary_faction_id field + existing relationships
   - Pros: Best of both worlds, maintains flexibility
   - Cons: Additional complexity

### Phase 3: Implementation (Based on chosen approach)

#### If Option A (Direct Fields):
8. Create database migration adding member_of_faction_id and faction_role to characters
9. Update Character schema with new fields and validations
10. Modify character creation/update API endpoints
11. Update swagger documentation
12. Write tests for new functionality
13. Ensure faction_role validation when member_of_faction_id is present

#### If Option B (Enhance Existing):
8. Add primary_faction concept to existing CharacterFaction relationships
9. Update API responses to include primary faction info
10. Enhance swagger docs to clarify primary faction usage
11. Add helper functions for primary faction access
12. Update tests to cover primary faction scenarios

#### If Option C (Hybrid):
8. Create migration for primary_faction_id field only
9. Update Character schema with primary faction relationship
10. Add business logic to sync primary faction with relationships
11. Update APIs to handle both direct field and relationships
12. Comprehensive testing of both systems
13. Update documentation for dual approach

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (1 hour)
14. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
15. Test faction membership scenarios end-to-end
16. Update API documentation and examples
17. Verify swagger spec accuracy
18. Performance testing for faction queries

### Phase 5: Code Review & Finalization (30 min)
19. Self-review implementation against acceptance criteria
20. Ensure consistent code style and patterns
21. Verify all edge cases are handled
22. Final documentation updates

## Recommendation

I recommend **Option C (Hybrid approach)** as it provides the direct access requested in the acceptance criteria while preserving the existing robust relationship system for complex scenarios.
