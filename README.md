# GameMasterCore

**GameMasterCore** is a Phoenix-based backend API for managing tabletop RPG campaigns. It provides a comprehensive system for organizing characters, factions, locations, quests, objectives, and notesâ€”everything a game master needs to run rich, interconnected campaign worlds.

## Features

- **Campaign Management**: Create and manage multiple game campaigns with member permissions
- **World Building**: Track characters, factions, locations, and their complex relationships

## Frontend Client

This backend is designed to work with [**game-master-web**](https://github.com/Callumk7/game-master-web), a modern web interface for interacting with your campaigns.
